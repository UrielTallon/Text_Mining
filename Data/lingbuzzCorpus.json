structure of the left periphery\u2019 i provide arguments from basa\u0300a\u0301 a noun class focus-drop topic-drop and tone language from the bantu language family spoken in cameroon that scope-discourse properties such as focus topic interrogation evidentiality and the like are grammatical primitives which take part in the syntactic derivation in line with the current cartographic approach to syntactic structures it is shown that basa\u0300a\u0301 like many other natural languages is inclined to using overt morphemes when expressing scope-discourse properties of interest is the fact that focus topic interrogative as well as evidential markers are realized only in ex-situ contexts and never in-stu it is demonstrated that just like basa\u0300a\u0301 expresses the iinflection-related information such as tense and aspect overtly so does it with information structure-related categories focus topic interrogation and evidentiality should be considered as formal features just like other formal features in order to achieve the goal of this work the analysis is based on rizzi\u2019s 1997 and subsequent works split-cp hypothesis it is showed that the basa\u0300a\u0301 left edge is a prolific and articulated domain due to a proliferation of different functional categories which \u2018populate\u2019 rizzi 2013 the complementizer domain of the language focus fronting topic fronting evidentiality as well as interrogation are expressed in the left periphery via the use of distinct and specific morphemes which signal the presence of each scope-discourse property in the sentence one salient characteristic of this language is that it exhibits rich agreement morphology such a property enriches its complementizer layer so much so that fronted foci fronted topics and evidential constituents trigger not only morphological marking related to each discourse property but they also trigger overt agreement morphology in addition to the clausal left periphery there exists in the language a low focus projection in the vicinity of the vp due to minimality effects this focus position attracts only wh-items and never focalized non-wh constituents it seems to be the case that the basa\u0300a\u0301 empirical material enriches not only theoretical syntax but also comparative syntax in terms of ellipsis a domain of linguistic theory which probably has not yet been significantly explored in the context of african linguistics at large and bantu linguistics in particular the study of sluicing and fragment answers is well accounted for under a restrictive theory of phonology-morphology-syntax and semantics interfaces and the division of labour between these interfaces such a theory does justice to the ellipsis approach according to which these constructions involve pf-deletion of the propositions out of which extraction has been applied prior to a-bar movement of the sluiced or the fragment thus the major contribution of basa\u0300a\u0301 is that the e-feature which is responsible for ellipsis and which has been said to be covertly realized in english-like languages can be sometimes realized overtly in basaa\u0301 this state of affairs confirms the claim that basa\u0300a\u0301 is a mixed language ie it is in-between languages with overt formal features and those with covert features overall failure to include scope discourse categories in core syntax would violate the inclusiveness condition chomsky 1995 aboh 2010 and would lead to a purely impoverished traditional syntax which requires that syntactic structures be confined to the sole classical c-i-v architecture as defended by minimalist syntax and as opposed to cartography which militates in favour of a detailed articulated and precise study of syntactic atoms in terms of content number hierarchical order and function  globally the study proposes a novel framework for the derivation of focus and topic fronting in basa\u0300a\u0301 more precisely it is proposed that focus and topic except hanging and frame setting topics fronting involve a bi-clausal non-cleft structure which requires that focalized/topicalized elements get moved into the embedded focp/topp first prior to moving into the matrix tp position for the purpose of the epp while the first movement step is said to be motivated scope-discourse requirements namely focus and topic the second one is motivated by the epp ie the requirement that the matrix tp should have a subject this second movement operation is attributed to the unavailability in the language of expletive/dummy subjects that would otherwise satisfy the epp in the matrix tp fragment answers by virtue of being considered as fronted foci are also derived using the same mechanism except in a very rare case while sluicing is said to be derived by wh-movement of the sluiced into spec-evidp or spec-wh-p depending on the nature of the wh-item whereas the target of ellipsis in fragment answers is a functional focp projection in almost all cases what deletes in the context of sluicing is an agrsp projection the idea that focus and topic fronting are not cleft constructions pertains to their semantic interpretation focus fronting is not necessarily associated with exhaustive or contrastive interpretation in light or their morphosyntax semantics and pragmatics exhaustivity and contrastiveness can be attested only in specific discourse contexts the semantic interpretation of  topics never allows them to be exhaustive and their contrastive interpretation is not that of exclusion as expected from bona fide clefts the basaa\u0301 clausal left periphery is a prolific composite complex and articulated layer which is made up of four main sub-domains as briefly depicted in the following snapshot {domain a[fixed word order] forcep  >  intp  >  }{domain b[flexible word order] topp[scene setting]  > topp[hanging] > wh-p}{domain c[flexible word order]

        "exc": "this work presents an unorthodox approach to phonology in which phonology as a module of the faculty of language comprises two levels morphophonemic and phonological\u2013phonetic this distinction largely follows the lexical and post-lexical split-component architecture of lexical phonology it is viewed from a different perspective though what is proposed is that the morphophonemic level of language is based on workspaces that are built from autosegmental representations the building blocks are neither spe-type feature matrices nor features used in sagey\u2019s 1986 feature geometry instead these are privative features used in government phonology whose phonetic interpretation is cued not only by paradigmatic relations between features defining particular autosegments but also by syntagmatic relations between features defining adjacent autosegments in a way this work pushes gussmann\u2019s 2007 treatment of the latter notion to a logical end the rationale behind postulating this type of phonological analysis is explained in chapter 1 where emphasis is put on the deficit of explanatory power that earlier theories of phonology had  chapter 2 presents the architecture of workspace phonology which is the model that is endorsed in this work this chapter shows how the new proposal differs from the two theories on which it is based these are lexical phonology kiparsky 1982ab booij \u2014 rubach 1984 1987 mohanan 1982 1986 and cvcv scheer 2004 et seq  chapter 3 discusses the morphophonemic and phonological\u2013phonetic aspects of palatalisation in polish the discussion stresses the difference between the morphophonemic side of the process and the phonological\u2013phonetic side of the process the latter is independent of morphophonemic considerations and it concerns language-specific limitations on the phonetic interpretation of polish the chapter includes an excursus on the notions of the strict cycle and derived environment although these issues are important to lexical phonology they almost do not exist in government phonology the excursus shows that both notions are relevant to the theory proposed in this work the analysis of palatalisation as such provides some explanation as to the cause of the systematic duality of polish palatalisation it also dares to speculate which factors allow foreign vocabulary to be used in polish even if it contains non-native non-slavic word-internal syntagmatic morphophonemic relations an example at hand is the foreign word sinus \u201ca sine\u201d which contains the sequence [s\u02b2i] which not found in any native word of polish the sequence in question however can freely occur at word boundaries as in the phrase pies i kot \u201ca dog and a cat\u201d the discussion points to the validity of the split-component approach to phonology  chapter 4 discusses voice phenomena in polish phonology with emphasis on so-called poznan\u2013cracow voicing it is shown that government phonology is unable to give a satisfactory answer to the question why this phenomenon is found at word boundaries but not at word-internal morphological boundaries it is postulated that the word boundary is a phonological object that can be expressed without recourse to spe-type [\u2013segment] segments which is in the spirit of cvcv poznan\u2013cracow voicing is demoted to the interpretive component in which the word boundary acts as the trigger for the process the boundary is expressed as a break between linearly-ordered morphophonemic representations furthermore dialectal variation in voice phenomena of word-final obstruents warsaw polish vs pozna\u00f1\u2013cracow polish is shown to be a matter of phonetic interpretation not a matter of morphophonemic representation  a discussion on voice phenomena and on palatalisation at prefix-root and preposition-host boundaries in polish given in chapter 5 points to yet another diacritic-free representational object in polish morphophonemics it is a domain breaker in the form of an empty onset + nucleus unit also called an empty cv this object has been inherited from cvcv in the present work it acts as a representational reflex of class 2 non-cyclic morpheme concatenation the discussion on polish prefixes and prepositions points to a way of accounting for the two patterns of word-internal palatalisation in polish representationally this is against multistratal word formation in lexical phonology where rules are ascribed to apply at some strata but not on other the analysis shows that polish prefixes and preposition need not be dependent on the ordering of affixes that are added to the root the morphophonemic effect of each affixation can be expressed by means of morphophonemic representations alone  english affixes with emphasis on the class 1 vs class 2 distinction are discussed in chapter 6 the distribution of the allomorphs of the regular plural is shown to be a matter of phonetic interpretation of one morphophonemic object rather than an instance of lexical selection the discussion presents the premises on which this conclusion is drawn the remainder of the chapter has concentrated on representational distinction between class 1 and class 2 affixation whereby the empty cv is shown to be a viable object for the morphophonemics of english too an excursus on the distribution of the sounds [\u014b] and [\u014b\u0261] in english points to the duality of the underlying sequence //\u014b\u0261// for instance depending on whether an underlying morpheme-final //\u014b\u0261// is followed by a class 1 or a class 2 suffix it may result in the minimal pair long\u2013er the comparative vs long\u2013er \u2018he who longs\u2019 this is somewhat parallel to the duality of palatalisation in polish where the pattern of palatalisation at prefix\u2013root boundaries is not the same as the one at root\u2013suffix boundaries for example a prefixed form of the verb intergrowa\u00e6 \u201cintegrate\u201d is z\u2013integrowa\u00e6 [z\u02b2int\u025b\u0261r\u0254va\u02a8] but not zintegrowa\u00e6 [\u0291int\u025b\u0261r\u0254va\u02a8] both phenomena have similar representational reflexes  finally chapter 7 ponders on the distribution of the post-alveolar central approximant sound [\u0279] in english with emphasis on so-called intrusive r the analysis shows representational differences between contexts in which intrusive r appears with a ranked probability the ranking order is taken from cruttenden 2008 the empty cv and the word boundary make an appearance once more adding to the body of evidence for the model of phonology that this work proposes"

        "exc": "the present dissertation is a laboratory phonology exploration of obstruent voicing before a following sonorant sound pre-sonorant voicing shows a number of recurrent typological properties that are challenging from a phonological point of view first voicing applies in the environment of a segment that is not contrastively voiced this raises the question whether sonorants may be redundantly specified for laryngeal features and if so how such specifications may be assigned second voicing is positionally restricted to environments where laryngeal neutralisation is also observed which has led some phonologists to propose a conditioning link between the two processes third pre-sonorant voicing displays an array of manner asymmetries with fricatives being more prone to undergo the process than stops even though there is no clear evidence for a preference for voiced fricatives over voiced stops in the languages of the world the segmental and positional asymmetries involved in conditioning pre-sonorant voicing coupled with questions concerning the role of phonological contrast have been the subject of active debate in theoretical phonology the present thesis attempts to illuminate this debate through systematic analysis of acoustic data from four languages west-flemish poznan polish central catalan and quito spanish the primary research question driving the exploration of the results is whether the studied cases of pre-sonorant voicing show evidence of phonetic gradience or whether their phonetic behaviour is more consistent with a categorical interpretation building up on this i consider which aspects of pre-sonorant voicing may be phonetically conditioned and what level of phonological abstraction is required to accommodate the observed empirical facts  empirical diagnostics for categoricity and gradience point towards the existence of cases of categorical pre-sonorant voicing which call for a phonological analysis however there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that the formal representation of pre-sonorant voicing involves redundant laryngeal specifications for sonorants instead i propose that obstruents subject to pre-sonorant voicing acquire a laryngeal specification not via feature spreading but through a context-sensitive process of default feature assignment targetting delaryngealised sonorants this process arises diachronically from listeners misperceiving passive voicing as the realisation of a voicing target as previously proposed by jansen 2004 delaryngealisation facilitates extended passive voicing by removing active devoicing gestures passive voicing may then be reanalysed as intentional i extend this perceptual explanation to account for manner asymmetries in pre-sonorant voicing the argument draws on perceptual asymmetries concerning acoustic cues to voicing in stops and fricatives which are potentially more salient in passively voiced fricatives than in passively voiced stops   while pre-sonorant voicing reflects some influences of functional pressures shaping its diachronic development the resulting voicing patterns are not always synchronically functional for instance   voicing in stop+sibilant clusters but not in singleton stops as seen in catalan is unlikely to reflect the direct phonologisation of phonetic pressures rather i propose a diachronic scenario involving rule telescoping a pattern of intervocalic sibilant voicing is first reanalysed as prevocalic by rule generalisation and the voicing target assigned to the prevocalic sibilant later triggers anticipatory assimilation the role of abstract phonology manifested here through rule generalisation can be further observed in the distribution of pre-sonorant voicing which in some cases is sensitive to the boundaries of abstract morphosyntactic domains as instantiated by the cases of catalan and quito spanish   i propose that functional phonetic and abstract phonological pressures on pre-sonorant voicing are best reconciled in a diachronic perspective where phonetic factors play a crucial role in the initial stages of sound change these phonetic factors are understood as influences on language use rather than being cognitively represented in the speakers' grammars the primary role of phonology involves replicating the patterns present in the input without direct influence from phonetic factors this idea involves a vision of phonology which is relatively abstract but which nevertheless retains a transparent mapping to the phonetics pre-sonorant voicing data lend empirical support to such a conception of phonology by showing evidence of categorical phonetic behaviour which does not correspond to phonological categories defined top-down using the criterion on contrast based on these cases i argue for a bottom-up model where abstract features emerge from the continuous phonetics and where categoricity rather than contrast is the criterion that determines whether or not a distinction is represented in the phonology"

 this question is even more intriguing when considering the french data under 4 these are well-known under the label of closed syllable adjustment since dell 1973 see eg tranel 1987 the important information here is that in french schwa alternates with zero and thus holds the function of the slavic yers  in spite of the identical empirical object 2 the french data have traditionally been analysed opposite to the way things were done on the slavic side anderson 1982 that is lower and its various modern varieties make the claim that vowels which alternate with zero are underlyingly present in the form of yers also these yers follow the last consonant of c-final words the rule then is that yers are vocalised before another yer else are deleted in other words [__c#] and [__cc] are interpreted as /__cyer/ and /__cyerc/ respectively and yer vocalisation then applies to open syllables only the french take is opposite alternating vowels are underlying present as well in the form of an empty nucleus but the rule of \"yer\"-vocalisation applies to closed syllables only that is __cyer is reinterpreted as __cyer by coda-capture \"make the onset of a nucleus that alternates with zero the coda of the preceding syllable\" hence the [l] of /ap\u00abl\u00abra/ will be captured to yield /ap\u00abl\u00abra/ and all /\u00ab/s in closed syllables will then be turned into [e] thus also the original ones in /ap\u00abl/  i argue that it is not by accident that the highly specific yer-context recurrently governs various alternations in different languages the same mechanism is at work in all of its instances making it a typological property of slavic languages is missing an important phonological generalisation furthermore i show that the french interpretation of 2 is wrong if the slavic analysis controls the french data then there must be yers in french this is of course outlandish as long as \"yer\" is a high centralised vowel that occurred in common slavic the modern interpretation of the word \"yer\" however has always been explicit on the fact that we face an \"abstract vowel\" this is the line of reasoning that i shall adopt \"yers\" are empty nuclei both in slavic and in french the idea that vowels which alternate with zero are actually empty nuclei has been developed in government phonology kaye et al 1990 harris 1994 since some time in this talk i thus aim at bringing together three traditions two of which are defined empirically slavic french while the third roots in a particular theoretical approach a side-effect thereof is also an account for the two major patterns of vowel-zero alternations that occur across languages havl\u00edk \"given a chain of yers counting from the right edge vocalise every other yer\" vs lower \"given a chain of yers vocalise all of them except the rightmost one\"     1 eg polish vojn-a \"war nomsg\" shows a vowel between the [j] and the [n] in case there is no expressed suffix vojen \"id genpl\" and when the consonant-initial adjectival suffix -ny is added vojen-ny \"id adj\" hence it looks like the alternating vowel is absent in open but present in closed syllables however its distribution is further complicated by the fact that not all open syllables trigger its absence namely if the following vowel is an alternating one itself the alternation site is vocalised pies \"dog nomsg\" ps-a \"id gensg\" but pies-ek not *ps-ek \"id diminutive nomsg\" the fact that the vowel of the diminutive suffix -ek alternates with zero itself may be seen in pies-k-a \"dog dim gensg\""

basic phonological objects such as long vowels geminates consonant clusters etc until very recent times however the only thing that has been done in order to discover the phonological identity of sc was to literally implement the 19th century wording \"a sc is a consonant in vocalic function\" following this stance the standard assumption in the generative literature is that sc unlike their non-syllabic instantiations that they may alternate with bott[l`]e \u0096 blottling czech v\u00edt[r`] \u0096 v\u0115tru \"wind nomsg genpl\" sit in the nucleus cf the replacement of [\u00b1voc] by

it builds on a property \"sc are functional vowels\" rather than on the behaviour of the object under scrunity moreover it violates the fundamental principle of autosegmental phonology according to which consonanthood and vowelhood is not decided by some inherent property of the segment but rather depends on the syllabic constituent to which a melodic expression is associated eg a melody specified as front high and unrounded will show up as a [j] if attached to an onset but as an [i] when belonging to a nucleus hence it is impossible for a melody that pertains to a nucleus alone to appear as a consonant in line with autosegmental principles some more recent interpretations hold that a sc belongs to an onset but in contrast to its non-syllabic peers also spreads on an adjacent vocalic position most voices believe that scs spread onto the preceding nucleus harris 1994224s hall 199235s wiese 19861996 toft forth but in some views spreading also targets the following nucleus rowicka 1999261ss blaho 2001 afuta 2002 rennison 1999333ss in this talk i argue that slavic provides critical evidence in favour of a left-branching status for scs the major argument grounds on the comparison of syllabic with so-called trapped consonants tc in slavic the former type of consonants is found in czech slovak and serbo-croatian while the latter is a notorious feature of polish compare cz t[r`]vat with po trwa\u0107 where the polish \"r\" is trapped both \"to last\" tcs have been extensively studied in work by rubach and others bethin 1984 rubach & booij 1990ab rubach 19961997ab but this was done on polish-internal grounds only on rubach's analysis tcs are extrasyllabic this position is at variance with the largely consensual peripherality condition \"extra-x syllabic metrical prosodic objects may only occur at the edge of words\" eg roca 19921994213 and makes polish the only language on record as far as i  know where extrasyllabic consonants occur word-internally  i propose an alternative analysis that builds on the behaviour of sc in czech/ slovak and tc in polish it turns out that both types of consonants show exact opposite behaviour a comparatistic approach is promising because both kinds of consonants share a common diachronic origin they occur in the same words with more or less the same meaning their antagonistic behaviour mentioned is obvious from the following check-list 1 syllabic consonants may bear stress but their trapped counterparts may not cz t\u0155vat vs po trw\u00e1\u0107 while polish has invariable penultimate stress 2 sc count in poetry tc do not 3 in case a vowel-zero alternation occurs to their left the zero alternant appears before scs which thus behave like a vowel but the alternation site is vocalised before tcs compare cz ode-brat vs od\u00f8-b\u00edrat od\u00f8-f[r`]knout \"to take away pf ipf to snort\" with po roze-rwa\u0107 roze-drga\u0107 si\u0119 where \"r\" is trapped vs roz\u00f8-rywa\u0107 \"to tear apart pf to become vibrating to tear apart ipf\" the polish situation is intricate full detail will be provided in terms of government phonology the latter fact betrays the identity of both scs and tcs the former must be left-branching because the preceding nucleus governs the prefix-final nucleus by contrast the vocalisation of the prefix-final site in polish shows that the nucleus preceding tcs is unable to govern in roze-d\u00f81r\u00f82ga\u0107 the trapped [r] branches on \u00f82 which then governs \u00f81 the working hypothesis which may be abstracted from this functioning is that scs are left-branching while tcs are right-branching this analysis receives striking support from the diachronic situation which is its direct translation as in all other languages this seems to be universal cf bell 1978 scs are not diachronically primitive they are created by the loss of an adjacent vowel in any event this holds true for both scs and tcs which arose from the loss of common slavic cs yers and it is a comparatistic fact that scs are the result of the loss of a preceding yer cs p\u044crv\u044a v\u044clna v\u044clk\u044a > cz prv\u00fd vlna vlk while

distinction \"syllabic\" vs \"trapped\" is not usually made on many occasions both categories are confused i provide extensive comparatistic material whose key actually lies in eastern slavic in order to establish this fact in sum the talk proposes a representational identity for scs that relies on their opposite behaviour in regard of tcs this result is gained on slavic grounds and builds on both synchronic and diachronic evidence it harmonizes with what we know from other languages and implies a number of consequences of more general kind among which the existence of \"empty\" nuclei to the left of syllabic and to the right of trapped consonants in fact they are not really empty because we can \"hear\" them they carry the syllabic/ trapped information phonologically as well as acoustically"

        "exc": "linguistics has long recognized that causation plays an important role in meaning over the last few decades of the generative linguistic project it has become clear that much of phrase structure is arranged around events or event-like entities such as situations and their causal relationships reference to causation in this tradition has most often taken the form of a relation cause with little further elucidation in effect treating cause as a primitive this treatment of causation as a primitive relation has proved adequate to the task of developing grammatical structures that make reference to causation but arguably this hands-off approach to the meaning of causation has obscured potentially relevant details impeding linguists\u2019 ability to consider hypotheses that might yield a more comprehensive analysis of the roles played by concepts of causation in language unpacking the notion of causation should on this view afford a deeper understanding of a range of linguistic phenomena as well as their underpinnings in conceptual structure  in this chapter we show how attention to the variety of existing theories of how causation is mentally represented could advance the understanding of certain linguistic phenomena in the first section we review the two major categories of theories of causation including some of the principal challenges that have been raised for and against each category we identify in the second section a range of linguistic phenomena that we feel would benefit from a deeper investigation into causation\u2014defeasibility agentivity and related concepts and causal chains\u2014and also speculate on how theories of causation might inform our understanding of these phenomena since the linguistic theories make testable claims about cognition they give rise to potential connections between syntactic structure and cognition in the concluding section we express our hope that further investigations along these lines may pave the way for a theory of meaning grounded in both syntactic and cognitive realities in a way that has not previously been possible"
